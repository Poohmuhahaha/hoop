      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Hygge Thoughts was born from a deep appreciation for Danish philosophy and the concept of hygge. 
        We believe that in our fast-paced world, there's immense value in slowing down, finding comfort 
        in simple moments, and embracing a more mindful approach to living.
